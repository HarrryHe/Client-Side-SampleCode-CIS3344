            <h2>My Web Development Experience</h2>
            <p>
                Throughout my web development journey, I have gained experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have built several websites, each one improving my understanding of web technologies. This project, in particular, has helped me solidify my knowledge of responsive design and JSON integration.

            <h2>HW01 Homepage</h2>
            <p>
                In this homework, I found creating the layout to be straightforward, as I am comfortable with HTML and CSS. However, working with JSON data was a new challenge for me. Understanding how to structure the data and link it effectively with the website took some time. Despite the initial difficulties, I found the process of integrating dynamic data with the website to be very valuable and rewarding.
